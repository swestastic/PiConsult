# TO DO

## Hardware

- Order LCD screen and try that since OLED has been unreliable
  - This will require changes to SolidWorks design because it will be a 1.9" screen instead of 2.42"

- ESP32, micropython? Or try to rewrite in C++ 

- Wire in additional two buttons

## Software

- Faster boot times for RPi

- Allow persistance / saving updated config files for settings like temperature and speed units

- Choose GPIO pins for 2 additional buttons

- Test DTC and make sure it communicates with ECU correctly

- Keep developing settings mode and think about if there are any other settings that could be good to toggle

- May need to run pip install configupdater on the pi
