# TO DO

## Hardware

- Order LCD screen and try that since OLED has been unreliable
  - This will require changes to SolidWorks design because it will be a 1.9" screen instead of 2.42"

- ESP32, micropython? Or try to rewrite in C++

- Wire in additional two buttons

## Software

- Faster boot times for RPi

- Implement code from SettingTest.py to have a functional settings mode

  - Update definitions in Read.py to generate correct data after changing units without needing a reboot

  - Update Read.py and main_bare_with_imports.py to refer to configJSON.json for values instead of config.py

- Choose GPIO pins for 2 additional buttons

- Test DTC and make sure it communicates with ECU correctly

- Figure out calculations for fuel efficiency. MPG might be on the right track, need to swap Km/L to L/100Km

- Figure out why data is being displayed as floats on oled

- Make PWM Configurable in settings

- Bypass connection if not plugged in
